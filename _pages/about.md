Hi, I am Yassine.

I am a PhD Student (July 2019 - now) working on Robust Machine Learning and Learning Control at the [Empirical Inference Department, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://ei.is.mpg.de/). I am advised by [Jia-Jie Zhu](https://jj-zhu.github.io/) and [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs). Before starting my PhD, I completed a Master's degree in Robotics, Systems and Control at ETH Zürich and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at ETH Zürich.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Stochastic Control and Reinforcement Learning with a focus on robustness. Initially, I started working on robotics, more specifically robot table-tennis. This experience led to my interest in robust/safe learning and control approaches, specifically robustness against distribution shifts in data.

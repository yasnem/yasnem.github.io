Hi, I am Yassine.

I am a PhD Student (June 2018 - now) working on Machine Learning and Learning Control at the [Empirical Inference Department, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://ei.is.mpg.de/). I am supervised by [Jia-Jie Zhu](https://jj-zhu.github.io/) and [Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Stochastic Control and Reinforcement Learning with a focus on robustness.
